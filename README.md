3. Now you have installed all the packages used on this project. Get ready to snipe vanities!
# Notes from the developer
- I need to say that this sniper was made in 30 mins (maybe under 30 mins), so do not judge me for such a simple vanity sniper and no file-structure.
- I have already made a better one that has a; custom logging system, file-structure, more useful and customizable settings and a cosy UI. If this repo gets 10 stars I'll release it (the advanced one).
